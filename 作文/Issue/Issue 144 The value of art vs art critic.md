This statement asserts that art, not the art critic, provides something of lasting value to society. I strongly agree with the statement. Although the critic can help us understand and appreciate art, more of than not, critique is either **counterproductive** to achieving th objective of art or *altogether irrelevant* to that objective.

To support the statement the speaker might point out the three **ostensible** functions of the art critic. First, critics can help us understand and interpret art; a critic who is familiar with a particular artist and his or her works might have certain insights about those works that the **layperson** would not. Secondly, a critic's evaluation of an art work serves as a filter, which helps us determine which art is worth our time and attention. For example, a new novel by a best-selling author might nevertheless be an **uninspired effort**, and if the critic can call our attention to this fact we gain time to seek out more **worthwhile** literature to read. Thirdly, a critic can provide feedback for artists; and constructive criticism, if *taken to heart*, can result in better work.

- ostensible 貌似是真的，
- paradox paradoxist 悖论 喜欢说悖论的人
- specious 似是而非的 paradoxical
- understand and interpret 理解与解释
- be familiar with 熟悉。。
- layperson 外行
- uninspired effort 无灵感的 枯燥的

However, *reflecting on* these functions makes clear that the art critic actually offers very little to society. The fist function is better accomplished by docents and teachers, who are more able to enhance a layperson's appreciation and understanding of art by providng an objective, educated interpretation of it. Besides, true appreciation of art occurs at the moment we encounter art; it is the emotional, even **visceral** impact that art has on our senses, spirits,and souls that is the real value of art. A critic can actually provide a **disservice** by distracting us from that experience.

- reflect 反思
- docent 讲师，讲解员
- encounter 遭遇，不期而遇
- visceral 影响内脏的 visceral impact 对人内在的影响。

The critic's second function -- that of evaluator who filters out bad art from the worthwhile -- is one that we must be very wary of. History supports this caution. In the role of judge, critics have failed us repeatedly. Consider, of example, **Voltaire's** rejection of **Shakespeare** as **barbaric** because he did not conform to neo-classical principles of unity. Or, consider the complete dismissal of **Beethoven's** music by the *esteemed* critics of his time. The art critic's judgement is limited by the narrow confines of old and established parameters for evaluation. Moreover, critical judgment is often misguided by the ego; thus, its value is queationable in any event.

- be wary of 小心，警惕
- dismissal 解雇 拒绝受理
- esteemed 受人尊敬的
- misguided by the **ego** 被自负误解
- in any event 在任何情况下

> Voltaire 伏尔泰 </br>
> Shakespeare 莎士比亚 </br>
> barbaric 野蛮的
> neo-classical 新古典的
> Beethoven 贝多芬

I turn finally to the critic's third function: to provide useful feedback to artists. The value of this function is especially **suspect.** Any artist, or anyone who has studied art, would agree that true art is the product of the artist's authentic passion, a manifestation of the artist's unique creative inpulse, and a creation of the artist's spirit. If art were shaped by the concern for integrating feedback from all criticism, it would become a **viable craft** (合格的工艺品), but at the same time would cease to be art. (同时不再是艺术了)

- authentic passion 真是激情
- manifest 显示，表明 manifestation 表明
- cease to be 不再是。。了

In sum, none of the ostensible functions of the critic are of much value at all, let alone of lasting value, to society. On the other hand, the artist, through works of art, provides an **invaluable** and unique mirror of the culture of the time during which the work was produced -- a mirror for the artist's **contemporaries** and for future generations to gaze into for insight and appreciation of history. The art critic in a subordinate role, more often than not, does a disservice to society by obscuring this mirror.
