## Task

As long as people in a society are hungry or out of work or lack the basic skills needed to survive, the use of public resources to support the arts is inappropriate -- and, perhaps, even cruel -- when one considers all the potential uses of such money.

### First Paragraph

The speaker asserts that using public resources to support the arts is unjustifiable in a society where some people go without food, jobs, and basic survival skills. It might be tempting to agree with the speaker on the basis that art is not a fundamental human need, and that government is not entirely trustworthy when it comes to its motives and methods. However, the speaker overlooks certain economic and other societal benefits that accrue when government assumes an active role in supporting the arts.

第一句概说话人观点，在一个有人缺乏食物，工作与生存技能的社会里，公共资源被用于支持艺术是不合理的。第二句解释了为什么，艺术不是基本的人类需求，并且政府并不完全可信。第三局指出说话人的错误之处，忽略了艺术带来的其他增长。

- unjustifiable: If you describe an action, especially on that harms someone, as unjustifiable, you mean there is no good reason for it.</br>
Using these missiles to down civilian aircraft is simply immoral and totally unjustifiable. </br>
The aggression into Iraq is totally unjustifiable. or U.S. military invasion of Iraq is totally unjustifiable.

> aggression ：词义宽泛，既可指武装入侵别国领土，又可指文化、经济等方面的侵略。侧重敌意行动和征服的企图。
invasion ：多指具体的侵入或侵犯别国领土，也可用于指抽象事件。
assault ：主要指突然而猛烈的进攻。
attack ：普通用词，含义广，指事先不发警告，主动地向对方发起武力进攻或对言论等进行抨击。
offensive ：多指进攻的态势，常指大规模的协同军事行动。

- in a society where ...... This means 在一个。。。的社会里  It is unfair to the civilians (or taxpayers) to share food suply to International Rescue for free, especially in a society where some people go with hungry(starvation) and unemployment.

> starve, starving, starvation

### Second paragraph

The implicit rationale behind the speaker's statement seems to be that cultural enrichment pales in importance compared to food, clothing, and shelter. That the latter needs are more fundamental is indisputable; after all, what starving person would prefer a good painting to even a bad meal? Accordingly, I concede that when it comes to the use of public resources it is entirely approprate to assign a lower priority to the arts than to these other pressing social problems. Yet, to postpone public arts funding until we completely eliminate unemployment and hunger would be to postpone arts funding forever; any informed person who believes otherwise is envisioning a pure socialist state where the government provides for all its celizens' needs -- a vision which amounts to fantasy.
