## Task

As long as people in a society are hungry or out of work or lack the basic skills needed to survive, the use of public resources to support the arts is inappropriate -- and, perhaps, even cruel -- when one considers all the potential uses of such money.

### First Paragraph

The speaker asserts that using public resources to support the arts is unjustifiable in a society where some people go without food, jobs, and basic survival skills. It might be tempting to agree with the speaker on the basis that art is not a fundamental human need, and that government is not entirely trustworthy when it comes to its motives and methods. However, the speaker overlooks certain economic and other societal benefits that accrue when government assumes an active role in supporting the arts.

第一句概说话人观点，在一个有人缺乏食物，工作与生存技能的社会里，公共资源被用于支持艺术是不合理的。第二句解释了为什么，艺术不是基本的人类需求，并且政府并不完全可信。第三局指出说话人的错误之处，忽略了艺术带来的其他增长。

- unjustifiable: If you describe an action, especially on that harms someone, as unjustifiable, you mean there is no good reason for it.</br>
Using these missiles to down civilian aircraft is simply immoral and totally unjustifiable. </br>
The aggression into Iraq is totally unjustifiable. or U.S. military invasion of Iraq is totally unjustifiable.

> aggression ：词义宽泛，既可指武装入侵别国领土，又可指文化、经济等方面的侵略。侧重敌意行动和征服的企图。
invasion ：多指具体的侵入或侵犯别国领土，也可用于指抽象事件。
assault ：主要指突然而猛烈的进攻。
attack ：普通用词，含义广，指事先不发警告，主动地向对方发起武力进攻或对言论等进行抨击。
offensive ：多指进攻的态势，常指大规模的协同军事行动。

- in a society where ...... This means 在一个。。。的社会里  It is unfair to the civilians (or taxpayers) to share food suply to International Rescue for free, especially in a society where some people go with hungry(starvation) and unemployment.

> starve, starving, starvation
> 同一句式的并列能够极大的增加文章的说服力，但是，难点在于词性的转换上。

### Second paragraph

The implicit rationale behind the speaker's statement seems to be that cultural enrichment pales in importance compared to food, clothing, and shelter. That the latter needs are more fundamental is indisputable; after all, what starving person would prefer a good painting to even a bad meal? Accordingly, I concede that when it comes to the use of public resources it is entirely appropriate to assign a lower priority to the arts than to these other pressing social problems. Yet, to postpone public arts funding until we completely eliminate unemployment and hunger would be to postpone arts funding forever; any informed person who believes otherwise is envisioning a pure socialist state where the government provides for all its celizens' needs -- a vision which amounts to fantasy.

### Third Paragraph

It might also be tempting to agree with the speaker on the basis that arts patronage is neither an appropriate nor a necessary function of government. **This argument has considerable merit, in three respects.** First, it seems ill-conceived to *relegate* decision and choices about arts funding to a handful of bureaucrats, who are likely to decide based on their own **quirky** notions about art, and whose decisions might be susceptible to *influence-peddling*. Second, private charity and **philanthropy** appear to be alive and well thrive, on donations from private foundations and individuals. Third, government funding requires tax dollars from our pockets -- leaving us with **disposable** dollars with which to support the arts directly and more effciently than any **bureaucracy** ever could.

- **patronage:** Patronage is the support and money given by someone to a person or a group such as a chrity. 资助 e.g. government patronage of the arts in Europe ... </br>
**patron**: 资助者， support 资助

- neither an appropriate nor a necessary ... 冠词一致。 **function** : *The function of something or someone is the useful thing that they do or intended to do.* e.g. the function of the government 政府职责 </br>
*If a machine or system is functioning ,it is working or operating.* e.g. The authorities say the prison is now functioning normally. </br>
*If someone or something functions as a particular thing, they do the work or fulfil the purpose of that thing* e.g. On weekdays, one third of the room functions as workspace. </br>

- **merit:** If something has merit, it has good or worthwhile qualities. e.g. The argument seemed to have considerable merit ... </br>
The merits of something are its advantages or other good points. e.g. They have been *persuaded* of the merits of peace. </br>
If someong or something merits a particular action or treatment, they deserve it. e.g. He said he had done nothing wrong to merit a criminal investigation. </br>
- Every one is selected on merit ...

- ill-conceived: If you describe a plan or action as ill-conceived, you mean that it is likely to fail or have bad consequences because it has not been thought about carefully enough. e.g. an ill-conceived plan to close the coal mine. </br>
**relegate** : If you relegate someone or something to a less important position, you give them this position. e.g. Might it not be better to relegate the King to a purely *ceremonial 象征性* function? </br>
**handful**: A handful of people or things is a small number of them. e.g. He surveyed the handful of customers at the bar. Also, A handful of something is the amount of it that you can hold in your hand. </br>

- **quirky**: something or someone that is quirky is rather odd or unpredictable in their appearance, character, or behavior. e.g. We've developed a reputation for being quite quirky and original. ```quirkiness```

- susceptible: If you are susceptible to sth. or sne, you are very likely to be influenced by them. e.g. Young people are the most susceptibel to advertisements. </br>
If you are susceptible to a *disease* or injury, you are very likely to be affected by it. Walding with weights makes the shoulders very susceptible to injury. </br>
A susceptible person is very easily influenced emotionally. e.g. Hers was susceptible nature.

- influence-peddling : 兜售 影响 ××××××

- charity ： *

- philanthropy :  慈善 = charity

- appear to be alive and well 看起来似乎有活力且运作良好。

- **bureaucrats** 官僚主义(者) **bureaucracy** 官僚主义，官僚政府

### Fourth paragraph

On the other hand are two compelling arguments that public support for the arts is desirable, whether or not unemployment and hunger have been **eliminate**. One such argument is that by **allocating** public resources to the arts we actually help to solve these social problems. Consider Canada's film industry, which is heavily **subsidized** by the Canadian government, and which provides countless jobs for film-industry workers as a result. The Canadian government also provides various incentives for American production compannies to film and produce their movies in Canada. These incentives have sparked a boon for the Canadian economy, thereby **stimulating** job growth and wealth that can be applied toward edcation, job training, and social programs. The Canadian example is proof that public arts support can help solve the kinds of social problems with which the speaker is concerned.

- eliminate : To eliminate sth, especially sth you do not want or need, means to remove it completely. e.g. The Sex Discrimination Act has not eliminated discrimination in employment ... </br>
When a person or team is eliminated from a competition, they are defeated and so take no further part in the competition. e.g. I was eliminated from the 400 metres int the semi-finals ...

- subsidized: 被资助 </br>

- film a movie / produce a movie.

- spark a boon for ... spark 火花 boon 恩惠

- stimulate 刺激 excite provoke irritate acivate

- wealth that can be applied to education, job training, and social programs. 背诵

### Fifth paragraph

A second argument against the speaker's position has to do with the function and **ultimate objectives** of art. Art serves to *lift the human spirit* and to put us more in touch with our feelings, **foibles**, and fate -- in short, with our own humanity. With a heightened seistivity to the human condition, we become more **others-oriented**, less **self-centered**, more giving of ourselves. In other words, we become a more charitable society -- more willing to give to those **less fortunate** than ourselves in the ways with which the speaker is concerned. The speaker might argue, of course, that we do a **disservice** to others when we lend a helping hand -- by enabling them to depend on us to survive. However, at the heart of this argument lies a certain coldness and lack of compassion that, in my opinion, any society should seek to *discourage.*  Besides, the argument leads **inexorably** to certain political, philosophical, and moral issues that this brief essay cannot begin to address.

### Sixth paragraph

In the final analysis, the **beneficiaries** of public arts funding are not limited to the elitists who **stroll** through big-city museums and attend **symphonies** and gallery openings, *as the speaker might have us believe.* Public resources allocated to the arts create jobs for artists and others whose **livelihood** depends on a **vibrant**, rich culture -- just the sort of culture that breeds *charitable* concern for the hungry, the helpness, and the **hapless.**

- benefit benefits beneficial beneficiary beneficiaries benefactor </br>
