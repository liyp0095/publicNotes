# Preparing young people for leadership

## Task

While some leaders in government, sports, industry, and other areas attribute their success to a well-developed sense of competition, a society can better prepare its people for leadership by instilling in them a sense of cooperation.

- instill 逐渐获得，逐步灌输 To inspire, impact and instill abundance in life. 为了激励，影响和灌输丰富的生活。

## Essay

Which is a better way to prepare young people for leadership: *developing in them a spirit of competitiveness or one of cooperation?* The speaker favors the latter approach, even though some leaders attribute their success to their keenly (敏锐的) developed competitive spirit. I tend to agree with the speaker, *for reasons* having to do with our increasingly global society, and with the true keys to effective leadership.

- soe favors sth. The speaker favors the latter approach, even though
- 背诵第一段的句式
- attribute sth to someone 分配 归功于

The chief reason why we should stress cooperation in nurturing young people today is that, as tomorrow's leaders, they will face pressing societal problems that simply cannot be solved **apart from** cooperative international efforts. For example, all nations will need to cooperate in an effort to disarm themselves of weapons of mass destruction; to reduce harmful emissions that destory ozone and warm the Earth to dangerous level; to reduce consumption of the Earth's finite natural resources; and to cure and prevent diseases before they become global **epidemics.** Otherwise, we all risk self-destruction. In short, global peace, economic stability, and survival of the species peovide powerful reasons for developing educational **paradigms** that stress cooperation over competition.

- nurture 培育
- mass destruction
- we all risk self-destruction
- epidemics 流行病 paradigms 范例，样本
- apart from = go without

A second compelling reason for **instilling** in young people a sense of cooperation over competition is that effective leadership depends less on the latter than the former. A leader should show that he or she values the input of **subordinates** -- for example, by involving them in decisions about matters in which they have a direct stake. Otherwise, subordinates might grow to **resent** their leader and become unwilling to devote themselves **wholeheartedly** to the leader's mission. In extreme case they might even **sabotage** that mission, or even take their useful ideas to competitors. And after all, *without other people worth leading a person cannot be a leader* -- **let alone** an effective one.

- competition 竞争（名词） competitiveness 竞争力（名词）
- instilling 逐渐获得
- input of subordinates 属下的参与
- sabotage 蓄意破坏
- recent 最近 resent 憎恨
- let alone sth 更别提。。。了

A third reason why instilling a sense of cooperation is to be preferred over intilling a sense of competition is that the latter serves to narrow a leader's focus on **thwarting** the efforts of competitors. With such **tunnel vision** it is difficult to develop other, more creative means of attaining organizational objectives. Moreover, such means often involve **synergistic** solutions that call for alliances, partnerships, and other cooperative efforts with would-be competitors.

- thwart 阻挠 使受挫 The accounting firm deliberately destroyed documents to thwart gonvernment investigation.
- tunnel vison 短浅的目光
- synergistic 协作性的 合作的

Those who would oppose the speaker might point out that a thriving economy depends on a freely competitive business environment, which ensures that consumers obtain high-quality goods and services at low price. Thus, key leadership positions, especially in business, inherently call for a certain tenacity and competitive spirit. And, a competitive spirit seems especially critical in today's hyper-competitive technology-driven economy, where any leader failing to keep pace with ever-changing business and technological paradigms soon falls by the wayside. However, a leader's effectiveness as a competitor is not necessarily **inconsistent with** his or her ability to cooperate with subordinates or with competitors, as noted above.

- tenacity 韧性 不屈不挠
- critical = important
- ever-changing 千变万化的 瞬息万变的
- technological paradigms 技术范例
- not necessarily 不需要 并不是必要的
- inconsistent 不一致，不协调，不和谐

In sum, if we were to take the speaker's advice too far we would risk becoming a world without leaders, who are bred of a competitive spirit. We would also risk the key benefits of a free-market economy. Nevertheless, on balance I agree that it is more important to instill in young people a sense of cooperation than one of competition. The speaker's preference properly reflects the growing role of cooperative alliances and efforts in solving the world's most pressing problems. After all, in a world in which our *very* survival as a species depends on cooperation, the spirit of even healthy competition, no matter how healthy, is of little value to any of us.

- be to do 按照计划应当做什么
- bred 孕育，繁殖 I was born and bred in the highland.
- instill in young people sth 使年轻人慢慢获得。。。
- growing role 越来越重要的角色、
- Nevertheless 否则
