# Task

At various times in the geological past, many species have become extinct as a result of natural, rather than human, processes. Thus, there is no justification for society to make extraordinary efforts, especially at a great cost in money and jobs, to save endangered species.

What are the limits of our duty to save endangered species from extinction? The statement *raises* a variety of issue about morality, **conscience, self-preservation,** and economics. On balance, however, I fundamentally agree with the notion that humans need not make "extraordinary" efforts -- at the *expense* of money and jobs -- to ensure the perservation of any endangered species.

As I see it, there are three fundamental arguments for **imposing** on ourselves at least some responsibility to preserve endangered species. The first has to do with **culpability.** According to this argument, to the extent that endangerment is the result of **anthropogenic** events such as clear-cutting of forests or polluting of lakes and streams, we humans have a duty to take affirmative measures to protect the species whose survial we've placed in **jeopardy.**

The second argument has to do with capability. This argument diregards the extent to which we humans might have contributed to the endangerment of a species. Instead, the argument goes, if we are aware of the danger, know what steps are needed to prevent extinction, and can take those steps, then we **are morally obligated to** help prevent extinction. This argument would place a very high affirmative duty on human to protect endangered species.

The third argument is an appeal to self-preservation. The animal kingdom is an **intricate** matrix of interdependent relationships, in which each species depends on many others for its survival. Severing certain relationships, such as that between a predator and its natural prey, can set into motion a series of extinctions that ultimately might endanger our own survival as a species. While this claim might sound **far-fetched** to some, environmental experts *assure* us that *in the long run* it is a very real possility.  

*On the other hand are two compelling arguments against placing a duty on humans to protect endangered species.* The first is essentially the **Darwinian** argument that extinction results from the **inexorable** process of so-called "natural selection" in which stronger species survive while weaker ones do not. Moreover, we humans are not **exempt** from the process. Accordingly, *if we see fit* to **eradicate** other species in order to *facilitate our survival*, then *so be it.* We are only behaving as animals must, Darwin would no doublt assert.

The second argument, and the one that I find most compelling, is an **appeal** to logic *over emotion.* It is a scientific fact that thousands of animal species become extinct every year. Many such extinctions are due to natural force. *In any event,* it is far beyond our ability to save them all. By what standard, then, should we decide which species are worth saving and which ones are not? In my observation, we tend to favor animals with human-like physical characteristics and hehaviors. This perference is understandable; after all, dolphins are far more **endearing** than bugs. But there is no logical **justification** for such a standard. Accordingly, what makes more sense is to decide based on our own **economic self-interest.** In other words, the more money and jobs it would cost to save a certain species, the lower priority we should place on doing so.

In sum, the issue of endangered-species protection is a complex one, requiring subjective judgements about moral duty and the comparative value of various life-forms. Thus, there are no easy or certain answers. Yet, it is for this very reason I agree that economic self-interest should take **precedence** over vague notions about moral duty when it comes to saving endangered species. In the final analysis, at a point when it becomes critical for our own survival as a species to save certain others, then we humans will do so if we are fit -- *in accordance with* Darwin's observed process of natural selection.

本文结构简单，分为两个论点。我们应当保护动物，我们不能无限制的保护。关于保护，一是因为我们有罪，我们破坏了环境。二是因为能力，我们有能力保护动物，在道德的高度上就应该保护动物。三是，自我保护。

关于保护的程度，保护并不是我们的责任或者义务。一是，达尔文的观点，灭绝式不可避免的自然过程。二是，我们不能拯救所有的物种，那怎么判断拯救哪个物种呢？作者的结论是拯救经济效益好的。

总结，相对于复杂的道德问题，从经济角度解决本问题更靠谱。当人类自身的存活遇到问题时，人们应当保护动物。
