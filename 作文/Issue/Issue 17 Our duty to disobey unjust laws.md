# Our duty to disobey unjust laws

## Task

There are two types of laws: just and unjust. Every individual in a society has a responsibility to obey just laws and, even more importantly, to disobey and resist unjust laws.

## Essay

According to this statement, each person has a duty to not only obey just laws but also disobey unjust ones. In my view, this statement is too extreme, in two respects. First, it wrongly categorizes any law as either just or unjust; and secondly, it **recommends** an ineffective and potantially harmful means of **legal reform.** (法律改革方式)

First, whether a law is just or unjust is rarely a *straightforward* issue. The fairness (合理性) of any law depends on one's personal value system. This is especially true when it comes to personal freedoms. Consider, for example, the *controversial issue* of abortion. Individuals with particular religious beliefs *tend to view* laws allowing mothers an abortion choice as unjust, while individuals with other value systems mitht view such laws as just.

- just 的含义是合理的，就是存在的意义是合理的。与公平性无关。fair; equitable; just; impartial; dispassion; 都是有公平的含义

The fairness of a law also depends on one's personal interest, or stake, in the legal issue at hand. After all, in a democratic society the chief function of laws is to *strike a balance among competing interests.* Consider, for exemple, a law that **regulates** the taxic **effluents** a certain factory can **emit into** a nearby river. Such laws are disigned chiefly to protect public health. But complying with the regulartion mitght be costly for the company; the factory mitght be forced to lay off employees or shut down altogether， or increase the price of its products to compensate for the cost of compliance. At stake are the respective interests of the company's owners, employees, and customers, as well as the opposing interests of **the region's residents** those health and safety are impacted. In short, the fairness of the law is subjective, depending largely on how one's personal interests are affected by it.

- at hand 眼前的 stake 重大利益 股份，桩
- regulate sth, 规定。。。
- effluents 污水
- lay off employees 裁员
- compensate 抵消 补偿 compliance 服从 顺从
- at stake are .... 事关。。。
- respective interests of 各自的利益

The secong fundamental problem with the statement is that disobey unjust laws often has the opposite affect of what was intended or hoped for it. Most anyone would argue, for instance, that our federal system of income *taxation* is unfair in one respect or another. Yet *the end result* of widespread **disobedience**, in this case **tax evasion,** is to *perpetuate the system.* **Free-riders** only compel the government to maintain tax rates at high level in order to ensue *adequate revenue* for the various programs in its *budget.*

- in one respect or another, 在一个方面或者另一个方面
- disobey disobedient disobedience 不服从
- tax evasion 逃税
- perpetuate 维持 保持
- compel  驱使 迫使
- adequate revenue 充足的税收

Yet another fundamental problem with the statement is that *by justifying a violation of one sort of law we find ourselves on a slippery slop toward sanctioning all types of illegal behavior, including egregious criminal conduct.* Returning to the abortion example mentioned above, a person strongly opposed to the freedom-of-choice position might maintain that the illegal blocking of access to an abortion clinic **amounts to** justifiable disobedience. However, it is **precariously** short leap from this sort of civil disobdience to physical **confrontations** with clinic workers, then to the **infliction** of property damage, then to bombing of the clinic and potential murder.

- sanctioning 实施 本文翻译为 支持更好
- justifying a violation of one sort of law 使违法行为合法化
- egregious criminal conduct 巨大的犯罪行为 egregious 极坏的
- precariously 不稳定 不安全
- civil 公民的，【民事的】案件
- <font color="red">confront</font>
- <font color="red">infliction</font>
- **from .. to .., then to .. , then to ...** 表明了一个递进的过程

In sum, because the inherent function of our laws is to balance competing interests, reasonable people with different priorities will always disagree about the fairness of specific laws. Accordingly, **radical action** such as resistance or disobedience is rarely justified merely by one's subjective viewpoint or personal interests. And in any event, disobedience is never justifiable when the legal rights or safety of innocent people are jeopardized as a result.

- inherent function 内在功能
- reasonable people with different priorities 有着不同优先考虑的理性人
- radical action 激进行为
