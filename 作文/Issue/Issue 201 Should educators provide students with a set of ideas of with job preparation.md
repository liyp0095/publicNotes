# Should educators provide students with a set of ideas or with job preparation?

## Task

The purpose of education should be to provide students with a value system, a standard, a set of ideas -- not to prepare them for a specific job.

## Eassy

Should educators teach values or focus instead on preparing students for jobs? In my view the two are not mutually exclusive. It is by helping students develop their own principles for living, as well as by instilling in them certain fundamental values, that educators best prepare young people for the world of work.

- mutually exclusive 相互排斥的
- it is by doing sth, as well as by doing sth, that someone prepare sb sth.
- instilling in sb sth 让某人渐渐获取....

One reason for my viewpoint is that rote learning of facts, figures, and technical skills does not help us determine which goals are worthwhile and whether the means of attaining those goals are **ethically** or morally acceptable. In other words, strong values and ethical standards are needed to determine how we can best put our rote knowledge to use in the working world. Thus, by helping students develop a thoughtful, principled value system educators actually help prepare students for jobs.

- rote 死记硬背 rote learning 机械学习
- figures 数字，人物，身形，轮廓
- ethically 伦理上的
- A 对 B 有利，所以做 A 就是做 B

Another reason for my viewpoint lies in the fact that technology-driven industries account for an ever-increasing portion of our jobs. As *advances* in technology continue to accelerate, specific knowledge and skills needed for jobs will change more and more quickly. Thus it would be a waste of our education system to focus on specific knowledge and job skills that might soon become **obsolete** -- at the expense of teaching values.

- advances 发展
- obsolete 废弃的，老式的，过时的
- at the expense of sth 以。。。为代价。
