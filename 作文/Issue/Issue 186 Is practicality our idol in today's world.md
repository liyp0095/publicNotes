## Task

Practicality is now our great idol, which all powers and talents must serve. Anything that is not obviously practical has little value in today's world.

## Essay

In today's world is practicallity our idol -- one which all powers and talents must serve? While this claim has considerable merit with respect to most areas of human endeavor -- including education, art, and politics -- I take exception with the claim when it comes to the direction of scientific reserch today.

Practicality seems clearly to be the **litmus test** for education today. Grade-schoolers are learning computer skills right along with reading and writing. Our middle and high schools are increasingly cutting arts education, which **ostensibly** / superficially has less practical value than other course work. And, more and more college students are majoring in technical fields for the purpose of securing **lucrative** jobs immediately upon graduation. Admittedly, (无可否认) many college students still advance to graduate-level study (深造); yet the most papular such degree today is the MBA; after all, business administration is fundamentally about practicality and **pragmatism** -- that is, "getting the job done" and paying attention to the "bottom line".

Practicality also dictates what sort of art is produced today. Most new architecture today is driven by functionality, safety, and cost; very few architectural **masterpieces** find their way past the blueprint stage anymore. The content of today's feature films and music is driven entirely by demographic considerations -- that is, by pandering to the interests of 18 -- 35 year olds, who account for most ticket and CD sales. And, the publishing industry today is driven by immediate concern to deliver viable products to the marketplace. The glut of how-to books in our bookstroes today is evidence that publishers are pandering to our practicality as well. It isn't that artists no longer create works of high artistic value and integrity. Independents record labels, filmmakers, and publishing houses abound today. It's just that the independents do not thrive, and they constitue a minuscule segment of the market. In the main, today's real-estate developers, enterainment **moguls**, and publishing executives are concerned with practicallity and profit, and not with artistic value and integrity.

Practicality is also the overriding concern in contemporary politics. Most politicians seem driven today by their interest in being elected and reelected -- that is, in short-term survival -- rather than by any sense of *mission* (使命感), or even obligation to their **constituency** (选民,选区) or country. Diplomatic and legal maneuverings (策略) and negotiations often appear intended to meet the practical needs of the parties involved -- minimizing cost, preserving options, and so forth. Those who would defend the speaker might claim that it is indealists -- not pragmatists -- who sway the masses, incite revolutions, and make political ideology reality. Consider idealists such as the America's founders, or Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King. Had these ideologists concerned themselves with short-term survival and immediate needs rather than with their notions of an ideal society, the United States and India might still be British colonies, and African Americans might still be relegated to the backs of buses. Although I concede this point, the **plain fact** is that such idealists are far fewer in number today.

On the other hand, the claim amounts to an overstatement when it comes to today's scientific **endeavors.** In medicine the most common procedures today are **cosmetic;** these **procedures** *strike me as highly impractical*, given the health risks and expense involved. Admittedly, today's digital revolution serves a host of practical concerns, such as communicating and accessing information more quickly and efficiently. Much of chemical research is also aimed at practicality -- at providing convenience and enhancing our immediate confort. Yet, in many other respects scientific research is not driven toward immediate practivality but rather toward broad, long-term objectives, public health, quality of life, and environment protection.

In sum, practicality may be our idol today when it coms to education, the arts, and politics; but, with respect to science I find the claim to be an **unfair generalization.** Finally, *query whether the claim begs the question.* After all, practicallity amounts to far more than meeting immediate needs; it also embraces long-term planning and prevention aimed at ensuring our future quality of life, and our way survival as a species.
