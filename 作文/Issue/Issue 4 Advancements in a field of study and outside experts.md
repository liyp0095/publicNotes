## Task

No field of study can advance significantly unless outsiders bring their knowledge and experience to that field of study.

## Essay

I strongly agree with the assertion that significant advances in knowledge require **expertise** from various fields. The world around us presents a seamless web of physical and anthropogenic forces, which interact in ways that can be understood only *in the context of a variety of disciplines.* Two examples that aptly illustrate this point involve the fields of cultural antropology and astronomy.

Consider how a cultural anthropologist's knowledge about an ancient civilization is enhanced not only by the expertise of the **archeologist** -- who unearths the evidence -- but ultimately by the expertise of biochemists, geologists, linguists, and even astronomers. By analyzing the hair, nails, blood, and bones of **mummified** bodies, biochemists and **forensic** scientists can determine the life expectancy, general **well-being,** and common causes of death of the population. These experts can also ensure the proper **preservation** of evidence found at the archeological site. A geologist can help identify the source and age of the materials used for tools, weapons, and structures -- thereby enabling the anthropologist, to extrapolate about the civilization's economy, trades and work habits, lifestyles, extent of travel and mobility, and so forth. Linguists are needed to interpret **hieroglyphics** and **extrapolate** from *found* fragments of writings. And an astronomer can help explain the layout of an ancient city as well as the design, structure and position of monuments, tombs, and temples -- since ancients often looked to the stars for guidance in building cites and structures.

An even more **striking** example of how expertise in diverse fields is needed to advance knowledge involves the area of astronomy and space exploration. Significant advancements in our knowledge of the solar system and the universe require increasingly keen tools for observation and measurement. Telescope technology and the measurement of **celestial** distances, masses, volumes, and so forth, are the domain of astrophysicists. These advances also require increaingly **sophisticated** means of exploration. **Manned and unmanned exploratory probes** are designed by *mechanical,* electrical, and computer engineers. And to build and enable these technologies requires the acumen and **savvy** of business leaders, managers, and politicians. Even diplomats might play a role -- insofar as major space projects require international cooperative efforts among the world's scientists and governments. And ultimately it is our philosophers whose expertise helps provide meaning to what we learn about our universe.

In sum, no area of intellectual inquiry operates *in a vacuum.* Becaues the sciences are inextricably related, to advance our knowledge in any one area we must understand the **interplay** among them all. Moreover, it is our non-scientists who make possible the science, and who bring meaning to what we learn from it.
