## Essay

Cars are a major **culprit** of **urban traffic jam** and air pollution, which makes many people hope that there could be fewer cars in near future. However, I do not think their wish would come true so soon. Instead, I believe cars will be even more **prevalent** in twenty years. Following are my reasons:

First, **economic development around the globe** means that more people will be able to afford cars. People will buy more cars because those machines enjoy **irreplaceable** convenience. Though bikes and public transportation like bus or subway are more environmentally friendly, cars **render more privacy** and are especially **convenient in emergencies or bad weathers.** In many places, cars are also a symbol of higher social status. In addition, the global population is still growing, so there will be more **potential consumers of cars.**

Second, a **crucial problem faced by cars** is fuel. Today's cars are mostly powered by gasoline, and such fossil fuels are **constantly declining in amount.** But even so, studies showed that petrol on earth is still enough to support cars for at least 50 years. Thus, the fuel problem wouldn't **threaten the future of cars** so soon. Furthermore, plenty of **motor vehicle** companies are working on **alternative powers**, and many have already made great achievements. Therefore, in two decades, we will probably have more cars powered by electricity or even solar energy.

Last but not the least, people are used to driving cars. It would be very hard for them to turn to more advanced vehicles like private planes. Besides, the major part of our **city traffic facilities** are constructed primarily based on cars, for example, **highways and turnpikes**. **Consequently**, it's not easy for city planners to change the **entire layout** of *residential areas where* live a great number of human beings.

Overall, though traffic jams or fossil fuel pollution are obvious disadvantage of cars that we want to prevent, there won't be a decrease in the amount of cars in mere 20 years.
