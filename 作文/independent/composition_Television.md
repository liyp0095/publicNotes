Television is so popular today. With the great advancements and application of Internet and social network techniques, television is becoming more powerful and more effective in today's life. And it changes the way we communicate and the content of our communication as well.

Today's television is more functional and with the help of the Internet, it could provide interactive visible service. Everyday we use it to keep company with our friends and families far away from us. We could talk to them, show our lives to them and see their response at the same time. Television, generally, draws the distance between us closer and closer.

Not only the style of communication television changes, but also the content of our communication. There is so many TV programs and shows on television which have enormous viewers. Television viewers attracked by the same TV show will talking about it after work or at tables. The topics maybe go around about who is the best actor or actress, or who is the funniest guy in the show. In this way, television changes the content we talk about and the life style more or less.

Television did not destroy communication among friends and family. Instead, it enhanced the communication by providing an effective approach to keep in touch with friends and families far away, which is once impossible, and so many topics and public figures to talk about. It enriched our life and we spent more slack time talking with each other face to face or via television.
