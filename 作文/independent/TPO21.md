When faced with the choice between interpersonal network and hardworking, the majority of people tend to have a favorable attitude towards the first aspect, especially for the person who is aspiring for a successful career. On the contrary, however, I definitely agree that hardworking in school is more important for success in a future job.

I concede that relating well to people in school servers as an independent factor in a successful career. Efficient interpersonal network always means more friends, who could offer you more helps and convenience in emergencies or bad conditions. What's more, relating well would offer people more information, which is particularly important for people doing business. Besides, to maintain good relationships is easier and more relax for some people than hardworking.

However, studying hard in school plays a more important part. For one thing, it is the solid knowledge of the field we chose that is the core-competitiveness. The society is fair and only people who have solid knowledge and the ability to solve problems could get good jobs. Under this circumstance, studying hard in school is the best way to equip ourselves. For another, hardworking person could always get others' attention and then get opportunities for promotion. Compared with people who spend less efforts on studying, hardworking people is more likely to overcome difficulties both in studies and after graduate. So employers or leaders tend to offer opportunities to those hardworking people.

What's more, personal improvement, both solid knowledge and the ability of solving problems equipped from studying, is good for our interpersonal network. People have the same knowledge background may share the same topics of communication. Moreover, people have strong abilities is always popular in social communications. Take myself for an example, when I finished my GRE test with a high score, I was introduced to several English-learning parties to share my study experience. On the contrary, a person will be exclude from certain circles if he/she could not follow or understand other members and making friends with him/her would be regarded as a waste of time.

In the final analysis, it is true that both relating well and studying hard are part factor for success in the future. However, considering the significant role of hardworking and its promotion to interpersonal network, it is sensible to make the conclusion that studying hard in school is more important for success in future job.
