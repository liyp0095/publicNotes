## Reading Passage
In the United States, employees typically work five days a week for eight hours each day. However, many employees want to work a four-day week and are willing to accept less pay inorder to do so. A mandatory policy requiring companies to offer their employees the option of working a four-day workweek for four-fifths (80 percent)of their normal pay would benefit the economy as a whole as well as the individual companies and the employees who decided to take the option. The shortened workweek would increase company profits because employees would feel more rested and alert, and as a result, they would make fewer costly errors in their work. Hiring morestaff to ensure that the same amount of work would be accomplished would not result in additional payroll costs because four-day employees would only be paid 80 percent of the normal rate. In the end, companies would have fewer overworked and error-prone employees for the same money, which would increase company profits. For the country as a whole, one of the primary benefits of offering this option to employees is that it would reduce unemployment rates. If many full-time employees started working fewer hours, some of their workload would have to be shifted to others. Thus, for every four employees who went on an 80 percent week, a new employee could be hired at the 80 percent rate. Finally, the option of a four-day workweek would be better for individual employees. Employees who could afford a lower salary in exchange for more free time could improve the quality of their lives by spending the extra time with their families, pursuing private interests, or enjoying leisure activities.

## Response

The reading passage explores the issue of the benefit of a new working policy in the United States. The policy requires companies to offer their employees a four-day workweek option. The professor's lecture deals with the same issue. However, he thinks that this new policy would not work, which contradicts what the reading states. And in the lecture, he uses three specific points to support his idea.

First, unlike the statement in the reading passage, the professor argue that offer the four-day workweek option will cost companies more money, instead of fairly equal one. This is because salaries is not the only outcomes for companies, also playing an important part is infrastructure constructions, like working space, computers and medical security. Obviously, the increase of employee numbers would rise these cost.

Moreover, despite the statement in the reading that four-day workweek option could reduce the unemployment rate as a whole across the states, the professor contends that if the employers make available employees work overtime no additional jobs will appear. In other words, unemployment rate is still a problem, which is related to companies' decision.

Finally, the professor asserts that people chose the four-day option will have less possibility to get a success career whereas the author of the reading claims that more free time for individual employees would bring benefit to their lives. The professor proves his claims by pointing out that employers would prefer hard-work staffs and they have more opportunities to promote to a higher office.
